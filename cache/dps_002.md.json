PLAINTIFF\n**Name:** Robert Zimmermann\n**Address:** Goethestra\u00dfe 78, 60313 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n**Employee ID:** EMP-2020-1205\n**Position:** Marketing Manager\n**Department:** Marketing & Communications\n**Hire Date:** September 15, 2020\n\n## DEFENDANT\n**Company:** GlobalTrade AG\n**Address:** Mainzer Landstra\u00dfe 200, 60327 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n**Legal Representative:** Prof. Dr. Andrea Schulz, Attorney\n**HR Contact:** Michael Braun, Head of Human Resources\n\n---\n\n## STATEMENT OF CLAIM\n\n### I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n1. **Employment Relationship**\n   - The Plaintiff was employed by Defendant as Marketing Manager from September 15, 2020, until the contested dismissal on March 31, 2024.\n   - The employment was governed by a comprehensive employment agreement dated September 1, 2020.\n   - Plaintiff's monthly gross salary was \u20ac5,800, plus performance bonuses.\n\n2. **Dismissal Notice**\n   - On March 1, 2024, Defendant delivered a written dismissal notice effective March 31, 2024.\n   - The stated reason was \"elimination of position due to digital transformation initiatives.\"\n   - The dismissal came without prior warning or performance improvement discussions.\n\n3. **Circumstances Leading to Dismissal**\n   - Defendant claims the marketing department is being restructured to focus on digital channels.\n   - However, Plaintiff had successfully led multiple digital marketing campaigns with measurable ROI improvements.\n   - Defendant hired external consultants for digital marketing projects while dismissing internal expertise.\n\n### II. LEGAL GROUNDS\n\n1. **Violation of Dismissal Protection Act (KSchG)**\n   - The dismissal lacks genuine operational necessity under \u00a7 1 KSchG.\n   - Defendant failed to properly apply social selection criteria under \u00a7 1 Abs. 3 KSchG.\n   - Inadequate consultation with employee representatives.\n\n2. **Procedural Violations**\n   - Notice period of 30 days insufficient (should be 2 months per \u00a7 622 BGB).\n   - No consideration of retraining or repositioning within the company.\n   - Failure to provide detailed justification for position elimination.\n\n3. **Discriminatory Practices**\n   - Selection appears to target employees over 40 years of age.\n   - Younger, less experienced employees retained in similar roles.\n   - Violation of Age Discrimination in Employment Act (AGG).\n\n### III. RELIEF SOUGHT\n\nThe Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Honorable Court:\n\n1. **Primary Relief:**\n   - Declare the dismissal of March 31, 2024, legally invalid and void.\n   - Order immediate reinstatement of Plaintiff to his former position or equivalent role.\n   - Award back pay from April 1, 2024, until actual reinstatement.\n\n2. **Alternative Relief:**\n   - If reinstatement is not possible, award severance compensation of \u20ac34,800 (6 months' salary).\n   - Compensate for lost performance bonuses and benefits.\n\n3. **Additional Relief:**\n   - Award reasonable attorney's fees and litigation costs.\n   - Provide such other relief as justice requires.\n\n---\n\n## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\n### Documents Attached:\n- A. Employment Agreement dated September 1, 2020\n- B. Dismissal Notice dated March 1, 2024\n- C. Performance Reviews and Campaign Results 2020-2023\n- D. Email Communications regarding digital marketing projects\n- E. Consultant Contracts for marketing services\n- F. Department Restructuring Announcement\n\n### Witness List:\n1. **Sandra Meier** - Marketing Coordinator, can testify to Plaintiff's contributions\n2. **Dr. Frank Weber** - Former Marketing Director\n3. **Lisa Hoffmann** - Employee Representative\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe dismissal of Robert Zimmermann was unjustified and violated fundamental principles of German employment protection law. The Defendant's failure to follow proper procedures and consider alternatives renders the dismissal invalid. Plaintiff seeks reinstatement and appropriate compensation for this unlawful termination.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n**Attorney for Plaintiff**\nRechtsanwalt Marcus Klein\nKlein Legal Services\nKaiserstra\u00dfe 45, 60329 Frankfurt am Main\nTel: +49 69 987 6543\nEmail: m.klein@klein-legal.de\n\n---\n\n**Date:** April 2, 2024\n**Signature:** [Marcus Klein]\n"}
