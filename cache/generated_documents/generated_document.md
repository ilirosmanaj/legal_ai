  "additional_factual_background_and_legal_arguments": "In support of the dismissal protection claim, it is pertinent to note that the plaintiff, Ilir Osmanaj, was employed by the defendant, Ilir, in the capacity of QA Manager commencing on January 01, 2024. The employment relationship was terminated effective January 01, 2025, with the notice of dismissal being served on July 16, 2025. The claim was duly filed before the Court of Prishtina on July 18, 2025, within the statutory period prescribed for such actions. The plaintiff contends that the dismissal was effected without just cause and in contravention of the applicable provisions of law, specifically referencing Article 43. Furthermore, the plaintiff asserts that the dismissal was not preceded by any prior warning or opportunity to respond to the alleged grounds for termination, thereby violating the principles of due process and fair hearing. The plaintiff maintains that throughout the tenure of employment, all duties and responsibilities were performed diligently and in accordance with the terms of the employment contract. The absence of any documented performance deficiencies or disciplinary actions further substantiates the claim that the dismissal was arbitrary and unjustified. In light of the foregoing, the plaintiff seeks reinstatement to the former position or, in the alternative, compensation in the amount of €50,000.00 for unlawful termination, as well as any other relief deemed appropriate by the Court."
