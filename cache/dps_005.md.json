DPS-2024-005\n**Court:** Labor Court Stuttgart\n**Date Filed:** May 3, 2024\n\n---\n\n## PLAINTIFF\n**Name:** Carmen Rodriguez\n**Address:** K\u00f6nigstra\u00dfe 67, 70173 Stuttgart, Germany\n**Employee ID:** EMP-2021-1456\n**Position:** Quality Assurance Manager\n**Department:** Manufacturing Operations\n**Hire Date:** November 8, 2021\n\n## DEFENDANT\n**Company:** AutoParts Manufacturing GmbH\n**Address:** Porscheplatz 1, 70435 Stuttgart, Germany\n**Legal Representative:** Dr. Wolfgang Benz, Corporate Counsel\n**HR Contact:** Ingrid Schneider, HR Business Partner\n\n---\n\n## STATEMENT OF CLAIM\n\n### I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n1. **Employment Relationship**\n   - Plaintiff employed as Quality Assurance Manager from November 8, 2021, until dismissal on April 15, 2024.\n   - Employment subject to collective bargaining agreement for automotive industry.\n   - Monthly gross salary: \u20ac5,200 plus quality performance bonuses.\n\n2. **Performance and Contributions**\n   - Plaintiff implemented ISO 9001 quality improvements resulting in 15% defect reduction.\n   - Led successful audit preparation for major automotive client certification.\n   - Received \"Employee of the Quarter\" recognition in Q4 2023.\n\n3. **Dismissal Circumstances**\n   - Dismissal notice dated March 15, 2024, citing \"elimination of redundant quality positions.\"\n   - Company claims integration of automated quality systems reduces staffing needs.\n   - No consultation regarding alternative positions or retraining opportunities.\n\n### II. LEGAL GROUNDS\n\n1. **Violation of Dismissal Protection Act (KSchG)**\n   - Dismissal lacks urgent operational necessity under \u00a7 1 KSchG.\n   - Improper social selection ignoring Plaintiff's performance and family status.\n   - Insufficient works council involvement in restructuring decision.\n\n2. **Procedural Deficiencies**\n   - Notice period of 30 days inadequate (collective agreement requires 2 months).\n   - No good faith consultation about position modification or retraining.\n   - Failure to consider Plaintiff's specialized expertise in automotive quality standards.\n\n3. **Discriminatory Elements**\n   - Potential gender discrimination in selection of quality staff for dismissal.\n   - Disproportionate impact on female employees in technical roles.\n   - Violation of General Equal Treatment Act (AGG).\n\n### III. RELIEF SOUGHT\n\nThe Plaintiff respectfully requests:\n\n1. **Primary Relief:**\n   - Declaration that the dismissal of April 15, 2024, is invalid.\n   - Order for immediate reinstatement to Quality Assurance Manager position.\n   - Payment of wages and benefits from April 16, 2024, until reinstatement.\n\n2. **Alternative Relief:**\n   - Severance compensation of \u20ac31,200 (6 months' salary).\n   - Compensation for lost performance bonuses and career advancement opportunities.\n\n3. **Additional Relief:**\n   - Reimbursement of legal costs and attorney fees.\n   - Injunctive relief preventing interference with professional references.\n\n---\n\n## SUPPORTING EVIDENCE\n\n### Documents Attached:\n- A. Employment Contract and Collective Bargaining Agreement\n- B. Dismissal Notice dated March 15, 2024\n- C. Performance Reviews and Quality Improvement Documentation\n- D. ISO 9001 Certification Records and Audit Reports\n- E. Works Council Meeting Minutes regarding Restructuring\n- F. Company Diversity and Inclusion Reports\n\n### Witness List:\n1. **Dipl.-Ing. Michael Weber** - Production Manager, familiar with quality improvements\n2. **Petra Hoffmann** - Works Council Representative\n3. **Dr. Andrea Schulz** - Quality Consultant, can testify to industry standards\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe dismissal of Carmen Rodriguez violates fundamental employment protection principles and appears to be based on pretextual rather than genuine operational reasons. Given Plaintiff's excellent performance and the questionable necessity of the position elimination, reinstatement and compensation are appropriate remedies.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n**Attorney for Plaintiff**\nRechtsanwalt Dr. Stefan Maier\nMaier Employment Law\nCharlottenplatz 17, 70173 Stuttgart\nTel: +49 711 234 5678\nEmail: s.maier@employment-stuttgart.de\n\n---\n\n**Date:** May 3, 2024\n**Signature:** [Dr. Stefan Maier]\n"}
